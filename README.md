Autonomous Mode:

  Scenario:
  
    a. A script should be used to train the model.
    b. The model should be saved.
    c. The Udacity Car Simulator should be launched in Autonomous Mode.
    d. A further script, capable of interacting with the Udacity Car simulator,
       should be run to send continuously automatically generated data to
       the simulator itself.
          ■ If the flow of generated data is not interrupted, the car will
            continue to move by itself.
          ■ If the model is not a good model:
              ● the car will not move!
              ● the car will go off the road!
